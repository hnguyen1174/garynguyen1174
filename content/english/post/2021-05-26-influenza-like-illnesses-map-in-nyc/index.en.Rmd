### Dataset

Total emergency department visits, and visits and admissions for influenza-like and/or pneumonia illness by modified ZIP code tabulation area of patient residence. The dataset includes the following columns:

* `mod_zcta`: modified zip codes
* `total_ed_visits`: count of all emergency department visits
* `ili_pne_visits`: count of influenza-like illness and/or pneumonia visits
* `ili_pne_admissions`: count of influenza-like illness and/or pnuemonia visits admitted to the hospital

### Visualization: Number of influenze-like illnesses visits per 100,000 residents

#### 04/01/2020: At the onset of COVID

#### 05/06/2021: Today

### Insights:

* Number of influenza-like and/or pneumonia illness admission increases in tandem with COVID cases.
* The boroughs (Queen and Bronx) have the highest cases

### Running the App:

* Step 1: Clone the repo: `https://github.com/hnguyen1174/shiny_contest_2021.git` on the command line.
* Step 2: cd `shiny_contest_2021`
* Step 3: In the R console, `library(shiny)` and then `shiny::runApp()`.

### Next Steps:

* Build a Lasso or time-series model to predict infection rate per borough
* Deploy the app to `https://www.shinyapps.io/`.
