<div id="project-objective" class="section level3">
<h3>Project Objective</h3>
<p>Through this project, I aim to help venture capitalists improve accuracy of their investments by understanding whether a start up will be successful through machine learning. A ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù startup is defained as one that would raise series B funding at minimum.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>For this project, we scraped Crunchbase and LinkedIn for 40,000 founder and startup information from 1968 to 2019.</p>
<p>These are a few notable observations from the data:</p>
<p>The total investment from Series B and above take less than 40% of the total investments.</p>

<p>Most startup investments come from the US, specifically the states of California and New York.</p>
<p><img src="crunchbase_country.png" /></p>
<p><img src="crunchbase_state.png" /></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the top 5 categories that receive the most startup investments are: (1) software, (2) mobile, (3) e-commerce, (4) enterprise software and (5) SaaS.</p>

<h3>Methods and Findings</h3>
<p>The K-fold cross validation result is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="crunchbase_kfold_plot.png" /></p>
<p>I chose random forest and XGBoost. Random forest has decent performance metrics, and provides feature importance. XGBoost, on the other hand, has both highest accuracy (92.42%) and F1-Score (87.26%).</p>
<p>The feature importance provided by random forest is as follows:</p>

<div id="insights" class="section level3">
<h3>Insights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even though the number of founder with business degrees is higher, I was able to deduce that the correlation between a founder succeeding if he has a computer science background is higher with good confidence. This can be due to the growing digital/software/data related startups.</li>
<li>There is a good chance of a founder succeeding if his alma mater is an Ivy-League/Top-School contrary to the popular belief of being a dropout. We hypothesize this can be true given the great alum network or maybe just the nature of the network a founder is exposed to in an Ivy league.</li>
<li>Number of founded organisations is negatively correlated which can be attributed to distraction.</li>
<li>More number of founders is negatively correlated to success. This is consistent with the idea: too many views (people) result into poor decisions.</li>
<li>Startups with highest number of investments are focussed at portfolio diversification as observed in our market basket analysis.</li>
<li>Most of the largest VC firms finance late stage rounds and tech companies. So more and more tech startups are blooming and most new start-ups are in the tech category.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="next-steps" class="section level3">
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apply the selected model on new startup (from 2020 and 2021) and perform qualitative analyses to see if the findings are still relevant</li>
<li>See how COVID-19 affects startup valuation and adjust models to avoid drift.</li>
</ul>
