Technologies:

* R (`ggplot2` and `tidyverse`) for data processing and visualization
* Python (`sklearn`) for logistic regression, SVC/SVM, random forest and K-fold cross validation

### Project Objective

Through this project, I aim to help venture capitalists improve accuracy of their investments by understanding whether a start up will be successful through machine learning. A "successful" start-up is defined as one that would raise series B funding at the minimum.

### Data

For this project, I scraped [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) and gathered data from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) for 40,000 founders and start-ups records from 1968 to 2019.

These are a few notable observations from the data:

1. The total investments from Series B and above take less than 40% of the total investments in the dataset.

2. Most startup investments come from the US, specifically the states of California and New York.

  </p>

3. Unsurprisingly, the top 5 categories that receive the most startup investments are: (1) software, (2) mobile, (3) e-commerce, (4) enterprise software and (5) SaaS.

### Methods and Findings

The K-fold cross validation result is as follows:

|Model Name|Accuracy|Recall|F-1 Score|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Logistic Regression|0.83|0.60|0.68|
|XGBoost|0.08|0.92|0.88|0.87|
|Random Forest|0.91|0.82|0.85|
|Support Vector Classifier|0.83|0.62|0.69|

</p>

I chose **random forest** and **XGBoost**. Random forest has decent performance metrics, and provides feature importance. XGBoost, on the other hand, has both highest accuracy (92.42%) and F1-Score (87.26%).

The feature importances provided by random forest are as follows:

### Insights

* Even though the number of founder with business degrees is higher, I was able to deduce that the correlation between a founder succeeding if he has a computer science background is higher with good confidence. This can be due to the growing digital/software/data related startups.
* There is a good chance of a founder succeeding if his alma mater is an Ivy-League/Top-School contrary to the popular belief of being a dropout. I hypothesize this can be true given the great alum network or maybe just the nature of the network a founder is exposed to in an Ivy league.
* Number of founded organisations is negatively correlated which can be attributed to distraction.
* More number of founders is negatively correlated to success. This is consistent with the idea: too many views (people) result into poor decisions.
* Startups with highest number of investments are focused at portfolio diversification as observed in our market basket analysis.
* Most of the largest VC firms finance late stage rounds and tech companies. So more and more tech startups are blooming and most new start-ups are in the tech category.

### Next Steps

* [ ] Apply the selected model on new startup (from 2020 and 2021) and perform qualitative analyses to see if the findings are still relevant
* [ ] See how COVID-19 affects startup valuation and adjust models to avoid drift.
* [ ] Refactor the repo and provide unit tests
