<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div id="overview" class="section level4">
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle game developed by <a href="https://tactilegames.com/">Tactile Games</a>. This is a classic game where you need to connect three pieces of puzzle of the same type to clear a board and score points.</p>
<p>As players move to higher level, they will see gates that ask them to either wait for a period of time, or make an in-app purchase to progress. In this project, I am interested in performing an A/B test to understand the effect of moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 on player 1-day and 7-day retention.</p>
<p>Retention is important, as in order to invite players to make in-app purchases at later rounds for monetization, we must first retain players.</p>
<p>While the number of games played is another important feature, I will not test for it in this project.</p>
</div>
<div id="success-metrics" class="section level4">
<h4>Success Metrics</h4>
<p>The project can be deemed successful if:</p>
<ul>
<li>From analyses, I can conclude whether moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 increase or decrease retention.</li>
<li>I can conclude whether the change is <strong>statistically significant</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>The dataset contains 90,189 players that installed the game while the A/B test took place. The features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>userid</code>: player unique identification</li>
<li><code>version</code>: whether the player is placed in the control group (<code>gate_30</code>; the first gate is placed at level 30) or the test group (<code>gate_40</code>; the first gate is placed at level 40).</li>
<li><code>sum_gamerounds</code>: the number of game rounds played by the player during the <strong>first week</strong> after installation</li>
<li><code>retention_1</code>: 1-day retention of player after installation</li>
<li><code>retention_7</code>: 7-day retention of player after installation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level3">
<h3>Method</h3>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="section level4">
<h4>Exploratory Data Analysis</h4>
<p><strong>Number of games played</strong></p>
<p><img src="users_gamerounds.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Only 59.4% of all users reach Gate 30, and only 65.76% of all users reach Gate 40.</li>
<li>We can see there is a peak at <code>sum_gamerounds == 1</code>. 5538 users only play 1 game.</li>
</ul>
<p>This points to a significant churn problem. These are a few recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tactile Entertainment should understand why most people only play a few games. Maybe the game is too difficult or not as interesting as other games.</li>
<li>Tactile Entertainment should understand while there are some people installing the game but not playing it at all. Is there a barrier, such as a bug, that prevents these players from playing the game for the first time?</li>
<li>Tactile Entertainment should explore avenues to retain users above level 1, such as unlocking features as certain gates or building a more compelling story.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are 3,994 users who installed the game but never played. It is odd that around 20% of these users have <code>retention_1</code> as TRUE. A data quality check is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Retention</strong></p>
<p>1-day and 7-day retention are not very different between two groups. The difference is bigger for 7-day retention.</p>
<p>The notable thing to point out is that both 1-day and 7-day retention are <strong>higher</strong> for Gate 30 compared to Gate 40.</p>
<p><img src="ret_1_7.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="bootstrapping" class="section level4">
<h4>Bootstrapping</h4>
<p>While the difference in <code>retention_1d</code> and <code>retention_7d</code> between <code>gate_30</code> and <code>gate_40</code> is very small, it can make a big difference when we look at millions of players if the game is grow in the future.</p>
<p>I would like to understand whether the difference is significant. Before A/B testing, I will use bootstrapping: I will re-sample the dataset with replacement for 10,000 times, and calculate 1-day and 7-day retention for those samples.</p>
<p>This will give me an idea of how confident I should be about the difference between gate_30 and gate_40.</p>

<div id="ab-hypothesis-testing" class="section level4">
<h4>A/B Hypothesis Testing:</h4>
<p>The general procedure to set up an experiment and perform an A/B test is as follows (step 3-6 are already taken care of).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understanding business problem and the data</li>
<li>Form a hypothesis and check assumptions</li>
<li>Build a randomization strategy</li>
<li>Set metrics</li>
<li>Choose a sample size</li>
<li>Collect the data</li>
<li>Perform exploratory data analysis and process data</li>
<li>Check normality and homogeneity</li>
<li>Apply tests (Shapiro, Levene Test, T-Test, Welch Test, Mann Whitney U Test)</li>
<li>Evaluate the results on the metrics</li>
<li>Make inferences</li>
<li>Make recommendations</li>
</ol>
<p>Hypothesis Testing Procedure:</p>

</div>
<div id="bayesian-ab-testing" class="section level4">
<h4>Bayesian A/B Testing</h4>
<p>In this project, I will also carry out a Bayesian A/B test using the <code>PyMC3</code> package.</p>
<ul>
<li>Priori: uniform distribution [0,1]</li>
<li>Likelihood: Bernoulli</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3>Results:</h3>
<div id="bootstrapping-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Bootstrapping:</h4>
<p>After bootstrapping, it seems like moving from gate_30 to gate_40 indeed <strong>lower</strong> 1-day and 7-day retention.</p>
<p>The probability that 1-day retention is greater when the gate is at level 30 is 96.23%.</p>
<p><img src="1_day_ret_bs_density.png" /></p>
<p>The probability that 7-day retention is greater when the gate is at level 30 is 99.9%.</p>
<p><img src="7_day_ret_bs_density.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="ab-hypothesis-testing-1" class="section level4">
<h4>A/B Hypothesis Testing:</h4>
<p>For both 1-day and 7-day retention, I first performed the Shapiro-Wilk test to see if the distribution is normal.</p>
<p><strong>Shapiro-Wilk Test for normality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>H_0</code>: The null hypothesis for this test is that the data are normally distributed.</li>
<li><code>H_A</code>: The alternative hypothesis is that the data is not normally distributed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the chosen alpha level is 0.05 and the p-value is less than 0.05, then the null hypothesis that the data are normally distributed is rejected. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, then the null hypothesis is not rejected.</p>
<p>In our case, both the control group (<code>gate_30</code>) and the treatment group (<code>gate_40</code>) are not normally distributed as the p-values are both less than 0.05. Therefore, we will go with the Mannâ€“Whitney instead of a standard t-test.</p>
<p><strong>The Mannâ€“Whitney U test</strong>
(also called the Mannâ€“Whitneyâ€“Wilcoxon (MWW), Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or Wilcoxonâ€“Mannâ€“Whitney test) is a nonparametric test:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>H_0</code>: null hypothesis that, for randomly selected values X and Y from two populations, the probability of X being greater than Y is equal to the probability of Y being greater than X.</li>
<li><code>H_A</code>: alternative hypothesis that, for randomly selected values X and Y from two populations, the probability of X being greater than Y is not equal to the probability of Y being greater than X.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our case, p-value &lt; 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and <strong>the difference between the control and the treatment group is statistically significant</strong>. It means that moving the gate from level 30 to level 40 actually lower both retention levels (1-day and 7-day).</p>
</div>
<div id="bayesian-ab-hypothesis-testing" class="section level4">
<h4>Bayesian A/B Hypothesis Testing:</h4>
<p>From the below observations, we have a 95.7% confidence that the retention for Gate 30 is greater than 40 for 1 day.</p>
<p><img src="1_day_posterior_rel.png" /></p>
<p>From the below observations, we have a 99.9% confidence that the retention for Gate 30 is greater than 40 for 7 days.</p>
<p><img src="7_day_posterior_rel.png" /></p>
<p>We observed that placing the gate at Level 30 brought greater retention for both the 1 and 7 days retention.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="recommendations" class="section level3">
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using all three methods (bootstrapping, A/B testing and Bayesian A/B testing), there is strong evidence that 1-day and 7-day retention will <strong>decrease</strong> if the gate is to be moved from level 30 to level 40.</li>
<li>Although there are other metrics to consider, if we want to maintain retention, we <strong>should not</strong> move the gates.</li>
<li>This result can be counter-intuitive. After all, if the gate moves to a later level, a user will have more time to explore the game and its features. Therefore, one could expect that moving the gate will improve retention.</li>
<li>A hypothesis is that: breaks in between games can help prolong enjoyment more as people tend to lose interest if they do something for an extended period of time. Therefore, having a gate at a lower level actually <strong>helps</strong> with retention.</li>
