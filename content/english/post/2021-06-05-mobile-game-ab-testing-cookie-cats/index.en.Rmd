### Introduction

#### Overview

Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle game developed by [Tactile Games](https://tactilegames.com/). This is a classic game where you need to connect three pieces of puzzle of the same type to clear the board and score points.

As players move to higher level, they will see gates that ask them to either wait for a period of time, or make an in-app purchase to progress. In this project, I am interested in performing an A/B test to understand the effect of moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 on player retention.

### The Data

The dataset contains 90,189 players that installed the game while the A/B test took place. The features are as follows:

* `userid`: player unique identification
* `version`: whether the player is placed in the control group (`gate_30`; the first gate is placed at level 30) or the test group (`gate_40`; the first gate is placed at level 40).
* `sum_gamerounds`: the number of game rounds played by the player during the **first week** after installation
* `retention_1`: 1-day retention of player after installation
* `retention_7`: 7-day retention of player after installation

### Method

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Bootstrapping

While the difference in `retention_1d` and `retention_7d` between `gate_30` and `gate_40` is very small, it can make a big difference when we look at millions of players if the game is grow in the future.

I would like to understand whether the difference is significant. In this notebook, I will use bootstrapping: I will re-sample the dataset with replacement for 10,000 times, and calculate 1-day retention for those samples.

This will give me an idea of how confident I should be about the difference between gate_30 and gate_40 - the procedure will give us an idea of how uncertain the numbers are.

#### A/B Hypothesis Testing:

1. Understanding business problem and the data
2. Form a hypothesis and check assumptions
3. Build a randomization strategy
4. Set metrics
5. Choose a sample size
6. Collect the data
7. Perform exploratory data analysis and process data
8. Check normality and homogeneity
9. Apply tests (Shapiro, Levene Test, T-Test, Welch Test, Mann Whitney U Test)
10. Evaluate the results on the metrics
11. Make inferences
12. Make recommendations

#### Bayesian A/B Testing

### Results:

#### Bootstrapping:

After bootstrapping, it seems like moving from gate_30 to gate_40 actually **lower** 1-day and 7-day retention.

The probability that 1-day retention is greater when the gate is at level 30 is 96.23%.

The probability that 7-day retention is greater when the gate is at level 30 is 99.9%.

#### A/B Hypothesis Testing:

For both 1-day and 7-day retention:

**Shapiro-Wilk Test for normality**

* `H_0`: The null hypothesis for this test is that the data are normally distributed.
* `H_A`: The alternative hypothesis is that the data is not normally distributed.

If the chosen alpha level is 0.05 and the p-value is less than 0.05, then the null hypothesis that the data are normally distributed is rejected. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, then the null hypothesis is not rejected.

In our case, both the control group (`gate_30`) and the treatment group (`gate_40`) are not normally distributed as the p-values are both less than 0.05. Therefore, we will go with the Mannâ€“Whitney instead of a standard t-test. 

**The Mannâ€“Whitney U test** 
(also called the Mannâ€“Whitneyâ€“Wilcoxon (MWW), Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or Wilcoxonâ€“Mannâ€“Whitney test) is a nonparametric test:

* `H_0`: null hypothesis that, for randomly selected values X and Y from two populations, the probability of X being greater than Y is equal to the probability of Y being greater than X.
* `H_A`: alternative hypothesis that, for randomly selected values X and Y from two populations, the probability of X being greater than Y is not equal to the probability of Y being greater than X.

In our case, p-value < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and the difference between the control and the treatment group is statistically significance.
