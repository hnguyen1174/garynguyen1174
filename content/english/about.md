I am a data scientist and NLP practitioner in New York City ðŸ—½. 
I am interested in deep learning architectures (BERT, transformers), new developments in NLP and data visualization. I have 2+ year of experience in data analytics and data science.
Originally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³, I earned a BA in Economics and Business at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania. I came to New York City to pursue graduate school, and got my first data science job at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In my role, I work on both operational and clinical projects. 

I am passionate about applying data science and NLP to solve tough problems in healthcare. I am also interested in time-series forecasting, deep learning, user analytics and MLOps. 

In my free time, I can be seen jogging around the Hudson river piers and taking photos in NYC gorgeous public parks.
