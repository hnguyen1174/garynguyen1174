title: About

I am a data scientist and NLP practitioner in New York City ðŸ—½. I am interested in deep learning architectures (BERT, transformers), product analytics, new developments in NLP, effective data visualization and MLOps. I have 2+ year of experience in data analytics and data science.

Originally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³, I earned a BA in Economics and Business at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania. I came to New York City to pursue graduate school, and got my first data science job at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In my role, I work on both operational and clinical projects to help radiologists and clinicians understand more about metastatic diseases through data science.

In my free time, I can be seen jogging around the Hudson river piers.
