I am a data analyst/scientist and NLP practitioner in New York City. I am interested in deep learning models (BERT, transformers), product analytics, data visualization and MLOps. 

Originally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I earned a BA in Economics and Business at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania. After working in consulting & analytics for a year, I came to New York City to pursue graduate school, and became a data scientist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In my role, I work on both operational and clinical projects to help radiologists and clinicians understand more about metastatic diseases through text data.

In my free time, I love hiking, photography and jogging along the Hudson river piers.
